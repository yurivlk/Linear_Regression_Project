# Introduction

The goal of this extended lab is to apply the statistical concepts that you have learned so far to real-world data both to practice and better understand how these concepts are useful.


# Getting Started

This lab consists of two parts: Data cleaning & Exploratory data analysis. You should begin with '1.-Data Cleaning.ipynb', and then move on to '2.-EDA.ipynb' as you will want to use the clean dataset you build in part 1 to complete part 2.


# Expectations

Write clean, well-commented code
Fully explain your responses where necessary
Refer to the lecture notes if you have questions
Don't be afraid to ask your TAs for help!
Deliverables
'1.-Data Cleaning.ipynb' with your responses
'2.-EDA.ipynb' with your responses

# Submission
Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
